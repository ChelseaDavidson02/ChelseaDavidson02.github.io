I am a 4th year mechatronics student who is interested in how AI and machine learning can be used in a wide range of applications. I am currently take this Image Processing course to better understand how AI can be used in image processing applications. I've really been enjoying the fastai course as it really makes me appreciate the work of the people who came before me, in making the integration of AI in image processing easy and accessable.
