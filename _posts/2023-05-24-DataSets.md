# Data Sets

## Three types of data sets
In order to train a model in fastai, you need to create 3 separate sets of data - training, validation, and test. The first set of data is the **training** set which is the data which you fit your model to. The **validation** set is used to give you an understanding of how well your model behaves to unseen data. The **test** set is then used to test how well your model works. The validation set is intended to be an approximation of the test set and used to tune your model. If you directly used the test set to tune your model, it invalidates the results as you would modify your model until you know it works on this supposed "unseen" data set.
